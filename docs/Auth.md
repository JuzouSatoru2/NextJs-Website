# Auth

> Secures admin pages and apis.

Admin auth is at the `/login` route and is handled server-side with cookies or local storage. The password can be set in the dotenv file like in the documentary mentioned.

The auth in docker services like portainer and mongo-express is handled by themselves or in the docker-compose file
